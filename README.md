# Data Driven Forecasting Workflow

A workflow for streamflow forecasting for rivers across North America, based on streamflow and snow water equivalent station observations.

## Description

This repository contains a reproducible data-driven workflow, applied to numerous basins, leveraging snow water equivalent (SWE) measurements as predictors and streamflow observations as predictands from datasets like CanSWE, NRCS, SNOTEL, HYDAT, and USGS. Gap filling for SWE datasets is done using quantile mapping from nearby stations and Principal Component Analysis to identify independent predictor components. These components are employed in a regression model to generate ensemble hindcasts of streamflow volumes for 75 nival basins with minimal regulation from 1979 to 2021. This work focuses on a user-oriented hindcast evaluation and provides insights beneficial to snow surveyors, forecasters, workflow developers, and decision-makers.
